# Adeept_Hexapod
The original code for the Hexapod robot provided  by Adeept is garbage. Large parts of the code can be simplified and placed into functions instead of CTRL+C CTRL+V, many variables are global yet only used locally at once location. While loops where for loops are suitable, broken features. The list goes on. This is an attempt to fix these problems.
